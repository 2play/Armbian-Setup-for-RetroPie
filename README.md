# Armbian-Setup-for-RetroPie revamped by 2play!
setup2play.sh is an updated bash script for installing RetroPie on the Asus Tinkerboard.

All other files are the changes MySora did to make for (BGM) background music or other extras.

This is an updated/revamped version for Armbian 5.60 kernel 4.4.152 (will be upgraded to 4.4.156) with a working libmali version r14p0.
